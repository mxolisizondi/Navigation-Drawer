# Navigation-Drawer
This is andriod navigation drawer

Im using fragments not activities

Fragment is a sub-activity or you can say an activity within a activity.

An activity can contain multiple fragments.

So since we dont want to close navigation drawer when option is selected we need to use fragments.

If you use activities you wont be able to see navigation drawer since you loaded another activity.

Make sure you understand the diffence between Fragment and an activity.
